# 📝 My First React To-Do App

Hi there! I'm Bessy, and this is my **first React project** as part of my learning journey into full-stack web development. I built this simple **To-Do list app** using **React + Vite**, where users can add and remove tasks easily.

This is just the beginning of my React learning journey, and I'm excited to build more real-world apps ahead!

## 🚀 What I Used

- **React** – JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite** – Fast build tool to develop and serve React apps quickly
- **CSS** – For simple styling

## ✅ Features

- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- View all your tasks
- Clean, minimal UI

## 💻 Getting Started

If you want to run this project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/todo-app.git
